Magic the Gathering is a trading card game that started in 1993 by Richard Garfield. What started out as a project to kill time in between Dungeons and Dragons sessions, has turned into a global phenomenon with people from all around the world playing and collecting its trading cards. 

The game as it is today has advanced since it started in 1993 adding to, and changing its rules in order to adapt to a more engaging play experience. As can be expected the rules of Magic are numerous and complex with most everyday players not noing how certain interactions work or what results from a game action. 

That is the goal of this project, to create an intelligent agent that can work as a judge for Magic the Gathering games. A judge that will have full knowledge of all cards and game rules and be able to reason what outcomes are the result from using these cards as stated by the rulebook. The intended use for this project is to have a chatbot that people can interact with while playing a game and quickly solve any dispute to continue play as easily and convincingly as possible.
